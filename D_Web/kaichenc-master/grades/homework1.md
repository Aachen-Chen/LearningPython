### Grumblr design process ( 10/10)

### Demonstrates basic familiarity with HTML and CSS

#### Completeness: Solution meets basic specification (15 /15)

#### Demonstrates understanding of HTML/CSS ( 12/15)
-.1, There are validation errors in your grumblr HTML.  High-quality HTML should always be validated using [https://validator.w3.org/] to ensure that it meets the HTML standards.
-3, You should avoid in-line styling (e.g. `style="..."` in tags) when possible. Using CSS rules instead will make it easier to find and apply styling changes to your pages.

### Appropriate use of course infrastructure and Git (5 /10)
-5, Your solution should demonstrate an appropriate use of version control.  Good version control entails (1) commit messages that adequately describe what occurs in your commits, and (2) commits that represent incremental changes.  For this assignment even the most slight use of version control should include at least two additional incremental commits: one for the design feedback and wireframe diagrams and one for the Grumblr implementation.  Because the design process and Grumblr implementation include many independent changes, a truly effective use of version control would contain many additional commits for each independent change.


#### Total score ( 42/50)
