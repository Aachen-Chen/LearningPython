### Committing your work (10/10)

### Specification fulfillment (25/30)
-3, Your app should not have anything other than calculator; for example, link to a debugging page.

-0, "Invalid PUT input" should be "Invalid POST input".

-0, It would be better if your divide button used the symbol `รท` instead of `/`.

-0, It would be better if your multiply button used the symbol `ร` instead of `*`.

-2, Your calculator does not allow negative numbers in continued computations.  Try "2-4*3"

### Validation (20/20)

### Routing and configuration (10/10)

### General requirements, appropriate use of technologies (23/30)
-1, Your file contains too many unncessary files, which hurts readability of your code. Try remove all dead code, print statements, unused html files, unused url paths, unncessary folders before submission.

-3, You should avoid inline styling and place all of your styling in your CSS file instead.

-0, Avoid hard coding in css file. Consider using `<table>` tag or `flexbox` css property.

-3, You did not explain in your README.md file why you chose to generate the type of request (GET or POST) that you used in your app.

-0, Helper functions are usually stored in a different python file than views.py (which usually consists of only views).

### Additional Information
I recommand putting unchanged variable outside the `cal` function, such as initial context and list of buttons (`setvalid`).
