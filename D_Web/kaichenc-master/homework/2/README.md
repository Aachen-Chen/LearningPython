To turn in homework 2, create files (and subdirectories if needed) in
this directory, add and commit those files to your cloned repository,
and push your commit to your bare repository on GitHub.

Add any general notes or instructions for the TAs to this README file.
The TAs will read this file before evaluating your work.

Instruction
Most functions are identical to a modern calculator:
- If you clicked "=", all datas are cleared for the next round.
- You can click operator keys and "=" anytime you wants.
- You can undo operator selection by clicking another operator immediately (except for "/", see below).
- Dividing by zero is an error.
Except for two differences:
- Integer math applied
- If you have clicked "/", you cannot click different operator keys immediately. If your wants to undo and choose another operator, you must first clear.
