Citation:

Bootstrap Library	https://getbootstrap.com/, 	location: src/vender/boostrap/*
Start Bootstrap Templates including:
	Clean Blog	https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/
		for navigation bar, row and column width setting, registration form
	Landing Page	https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/landing-page/
		for call in page UI, heading design

When citing Start Bootstrap Templates, I did not directly import the 
customized css library of Clean Blog or Landing Page. Instead, I read
through their source code, figured out how feature are programmed, and
alter the feature according to my wireframe. In the end, I created one
customized CSS library of my own for features including color, font and
layout.

My own CSS library: src/css/grumblr.css
Imported library: src/vender/boostrap/*
